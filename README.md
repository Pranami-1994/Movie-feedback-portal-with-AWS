## Project Description
CinemaPulse provides film producers with real-time audience reactions, enabling immediate insights into viewer sentiment. Built with Flask, hosted on AWS EC2, and backed by Amazon RDS, this solution ensures high availability, scalability, and secure access control, making it ideal for analyzing feedback at scale during movie premieres or blockbusters.

## Architecture
CinemaPulse utilizes:
- **Flask** for the backend application
- **AWS EC2** for scalable hosting
- **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** for secure and efficient database management
- **AWS IAM** for secure access control

## Features
1. **Scalable Feedback Collection**: Automatically scales with viewer traffic spikes during premieres.
2. **Real-Time Data Analytics**: Provides instant insights on viewer sentiment.
3. **Secure Access Control**: Implements role-based access using AWS IAM.
4. **Dynamic Frontend**: Interactive interface to view movies, submit feedback, and analyze responses.

   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Workflow

### Milestone 1: AWS Account Setup and Login
1. **Create an AWS Account** and log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

### Milestone 2: RDS Database Creation and Setup
1. **Create an RDS Instance**: Configure a MySQL instance in RDS.
2. **Database Access Configuration**: Set up security groups, credentials, and policies for secure access.
3. **Install MySQL Workbench**: Connect to the RDS instance and manage the database.
4. **Create Database and Tables**:
   - `users` table: Stores viewer feedback.
   - `movie` table: Contains movie details, including review count and average rating.

### Milestone 3: Frontend Development and Application Setup
1. **Build the Frontend**: Create HTML, CSS, and Flask templates.
2. **Integrate with RDS**: Connect `app.py` to the RDS instance using a connection pool for efficiency.

### Milestone 4: EC2 Instance Setup
1. **Launch EC2 Instance**: Deploy the app on a Linux-based EC2 instance.
2. **Network Configuration**: Configure security groups to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.

### Milestone 5: Deployment on EC2
1. **Deploy Application**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install python3 -y
   sudo pip3 install virtualenv
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install flask
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CinemaPulse.git
   cd CinemaPulse
   python3 app.py
   ```

### Milestone 6: Testing and Deployment
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify database interactions, frontend features, and overall functionality.
2. **Production Deployment**: Ensure high availability and optimal performance.

### Milestone 7: Monitoring and Optimization
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Use AWS CloudWatch for EC2 and RDS monitoring.
2. **Optimization**: Adjust configurations based on monitoring results, including instance types and query optimization.

## Conclusion
CinemaPulse demonstrates the power of AWS in building a scalable and secure movie feedback platform. This project highlights the importance of real-time analytics and provides a seamless way for studios to capture and analyze audience sentiment. With robust architecture, interactive UI, and cloud monitoring, CinemaPulse offers reliable insights that are critical for the film industry.
